    - Target Country: Russia -> All text must be in Russian language.
    - Target Country: United States -> All text must be in English language.
    - Target Country: Moldova -> All text must be in Romanian language.

    Identify core solution/value proposition from homepage, services, product pages
    Understand their unique selling proposition and main benefits they provide

    2. Ideal Customer Profile Intelligence
    Company Size Targeting: Analyze case studies, testimonials, pricing tiers, and service descriptions to infer:

    Do they mention "enterprise", "SMB", "startup" clients?
    What scale of problems do they solve?
    Do pricing/packages suggest company size targeting?


    Industry Focus: Look for industry-specific language, case studies, vertical solutions, regulatory mentions
    Revenue Targeting: Infer from pricing models, service complexity, and client examples
    Geographic Presence: Check locations, "serving" areas, case studies, contact addresses

    3. Lead Signal Intelligence
    Growth Indicators: What situations create demand for their solution?
    Pain Point Analysis: What problems trigger the need for their services?

    4. News Framework Strategy

    Intelligence Guidelines:
    Company Size Inference Logic:

    SaaS with $10+/month pricing → STARTUP, SMALL_BUSINESS
    Enterprise security/compliance → LARGE_ENTERPRISE, VERY_LARGE_ENTERPRISE
    Local services → SMALL_BUSINESS, MEDIUM_BUSINESS
    Consulting with complex projects → MEDIUM_BUSINESS, LARGE_ENTERPRISE

    Industry Inference Logic:

    Look for industry-specific terminology, case studies, compliance mentions
    Infer from solution type (e.g., restaurant POS → FOOD_HOSPITALITY)
    Check client logos and testimonials for industry patterns

    Decision Maker Logic:

    Technical/complex solutions → C_LEVEL, VP_LEVEL
    Operational tools → MANAGER_LEVEL, DIRECTOR_LEVEL
    Specialized software → IC_LEVEL, MANAGER_LEVEL

    Think about WHEN companies need this solution
    What business changes create urgency?
    What growth stages align with their solution?

    Consider what announcements indicate companies might need their solution

    Lead Signals: "opening new locations", "hiring kitchen staff", "customer complaints about wait times"
    News Keywords: "restaurant expansion", "new restaurant opening", "franchise growth"

    For Enterprise Security Software:

    Company Size: LARGE_ENTERPRISE, VERY_LARGE_ENTERPRISE
    Decision Makers: C_LEVEL, VP_LEVEL (security is C-suite concern)
    Lead Signals: "data breach incidents", "compliance requirements", "remote work adoption"
    News Keywords: "cybersecurity incident", "compliance audit", "digital transformation"

    Remember: Your goal is to create a lead generation configuration that will effectively identify companies who are most likely to need and buy this company's solution. Think strategically about timing, triggers, and targeting.
